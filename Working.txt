The block diagram represent the working of our project which is as follows: The camera module will detect and recongize the real time infromation of an object,then the camera module sends these signal to the single board computer.Now the signle board computer process this signal and perfroms operations like Object detection and recongiznes and finding the estimate distance between the object and the device and then produce the suitable audio through speakers or headphones. Here the GPS Module is used to send the real time loaction of the user to their families so we perform this operation through develop a backend server using the python famework fast API.Here we can use some sensor like Utrasonic sensor which will  help us to detect the accurate distance.Here is the power supply is used for circular power in the system.
